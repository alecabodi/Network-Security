# NetSec ETHZ Projects

My solutions to projects from Fall Semester 2022 in Network Security course at ETH ZÃ¼rich. 

### Project 1
Implement an ACMEv2 client according to [RFC8555](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555.html). 
The code has not been cleaned up upon passing the required tests and of course it is not meant in any way to be used in production.

### Project 2 
Solve DTF challenge proposed
